  <h2>💖 Meet the Creator</h2>
  <p>Hello there! I’m <strong>Jaymee Santos</strong> — a tech enthusiast who believes that beauty, creativity, and logic can coexist.</p>
  <p>This project showcases not only my coding skills, but also my personal style — 
  merging feminine design with structured logic. Through <em>if-else</em>, <em>loops</em>, <em>switch</em>, and <em>match</em>, 
  I’ve learned that programming is both science and art ✨</p>
